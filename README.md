##implemented
- regular gear changes
- comfort, sport, manual mode
- kickdowns
- aggressive mode overrides

plus a bunch of unit tests (they should be split way more - in general the sport transmission test works kind of like a set of e2e test scenarios which is sub optimal, but i'll never get this done if i don't stop somewhere)
